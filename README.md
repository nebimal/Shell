# Shell
This program implements a simple shell named `msh` that takes user input as commands, processes them, and executes the corresponding commands from the Bash shell. The shell reads and parses user input, handles command execution, supports basic features like redirection (`>`), and implements essential commands like `cd`, `exit`, and external program execution using `execvp`. If an error occurs (invalid command, incorrect arguments, etc.), the shell provides an error message to guide the user.
