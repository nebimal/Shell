# Shell (`msh`)

This project implements a simple shell named `msh` that processes and executes user commands. It serves as a basic interface for interacting with the Bash shell.

## Features
- **Command Parsing and Execution**: Reads and interprets user input to execute commands.
- **Redirection Support**: Implements output redirection using `>`.
- **Built-in Commands**: Includes essential commands like `cd` and `exit`.
- **External Command Execution**: Supports running external programs using `execvp`.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages for invalid commands, incorrect arguments, or other execution errors.

Feel free to explore the code, test the shell, and provide feedback!
